# Propylon Front-End Challenge

This repository serves as a guide for Propylon's front-end challenge.

1. Start by installing the necessary packages by running `npm install`.
2. To concurrently launch both the `backend` and `frontend` environments, run `npm start`.

## Potential Enhancements

In light of time constraints and the challenge's specific scope, a few tasks were skipped. In a real-world scenario and with adequate time, these aspects could be explored:

- [ ] Ensure that all components have associated unit tests.
- [ ] Consider refactoring and optimizing components where applicable.
- [ ] Explore the integration of Storybook as a tool to document and interact with components effectively.
- [ ] Implement robust documentation tools like Docusaurus to provide in-depth insights into components.
- [ ] Delve into a thorough implementation of `@emotion`.
- [ ] Collaborate with the team to establish a consistent and agreed-upon coding style.
- [ ] Evaluate the possibility of organizing this codebase into a monolithic repository with subpackages for individual components, although this decision would hinge on further discussions with the team and the project's objectives.
- [ ] Identify recurring patterns within the application and move them to the `shared` folder.
- [ ] Enhance the overall visual design for improved aesthetics.
